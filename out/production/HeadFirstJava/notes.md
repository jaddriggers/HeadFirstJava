## Steps to creating classes

1. Figure out what the class is supposed to do.

2. List the instance variables and methods.

3. Write prepcode for the methods. (Youâ€™ll see this in just a moment.)

4. Write test code for the methods.

5. Implement the class.

6. Test the methods.

7. Debug and reimplement as needed.
